HW3 Part-A Numpy - Relu Non-linear Implementation 

1. Generate data: 3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output 
2. Create Non Linear Data Model
3. Train the 3dim and 2output generated data using Linear model 
4. Add ReLu function to learn the non-linear data, we need non-linearities in our model.
5. Train the new non-linear model.
6. Fit the model and compute the cost function.
7. Plot the output post training as well as the real data  using tsne.
   Result: Similar plots but different values
 
# Assignment-3_part_b1.ipynb
HW3 Part-B2 Pytorch - no auto-differentiation Implementation
1. Generate data: 3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output 
2. Add ReLu function to learn the non-linear data, we need non-linearities in our model but didn't use it (no auto-differentiation)
3. Train the 3dim and 2output generated data using Pytorch
4. Fit the model and compute the cost function using Pytorch
5. Plot the output post training as well as the real data  using tsne.
   Result: Similar plots but different values

# Assignment-3_part_b2.ipynb
HW3 Part-B2 Pytorch - Relu Non-linear, with auto-differentiation primitive Implementation

1. Generate data: 3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output 
2. Add ReLu function to learn the non-linear data, we need non-linearities in our model.
3. Train the 3dim and 2output generated data using Pytorch, Test just one forward and backward step.
4. Test just one forward and backward step
5. Fit the model and compute the cost function using Pytorch
6. Plot the output post training as well as the real data  using tsne.
   Result: Similar plots but different values
