HW3 Part-A Numpy - Relu Non-linear Implementation 

1. Generate data: 3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output 
2. Create Non Linear Data Model
3. Train the 3dim and 2output generated data using Linear model 
4. Add ReLu function to learn the non-linear data, we need non-linearities in our model.
5. Train the new non-linear model.
6. Fit the model and compute the cost function.
7. Plot the output post training as well as the real dataÂ  using tsne.
   Result: Similar plots but different values
