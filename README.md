HW3 Part-A Numpy - Relu Non-linear Implementation 

1. Generate data: 3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output 
2. Create Non Linear Data
3. Train the Linear model
4. Add ReLu to learn non-linear functions, we need non-linearities in our model.
5. Train new non-linear model
6. Fit the model to compute the cost function
7. Plot the output post training as well as the real data using tsne.
